# Instrumented-glove-for-fingers-movement-tracking
Design a PCB for Inertial sensors system that embedded into gloves to track the fingers movement with high accuracy and high real-time response. 
# Challenges
Design a smallest PCB for every sensor unit, and consider how to connect every sensors which allocated in every finger joints . It also should care wear comfortable and low in cost. 

# Step 1
Design the schematic based on the 9-Axis MPU and the microcontroller.
